Vaultora â€“ Smart Inventory Management App(ðŸ“¦)

- Project Overview:
Vaultora is a lightweight and efficient inventory management system designed for small businesses and shop owners. Built with Flutter using MVC architecture, it leverages the power of Hive (NoSQL local database) to operate entirely offline, ensuring fast performance and data persistence.
The app empowers owners to add and manage products, record multiple sales, and monitor stock levels in real time. It includes detailed product and sales summaries, revenue tracking, and custom report generation. A unique feature is the calendar-based sales tracking system, which visually highlights sales activity by date and allows users to view corresponding sales data for each day.
